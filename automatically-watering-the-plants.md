# Automatically watering the plants

Fresh, clean water is a limited resource. While most of the planet is covered in water, it is salt water that can only be consumed by humans and other species after undergoing desalination, which is an expensive process. Occurrences such as droughts further limit access to clean and fresh water, meaning people need to take steps to reduce water use and save as much water as possible. In some areas of the world, access to water is limited due to contamination. People who have access to fresh water can take steps to limit their use of water to avoid waste. \(source: [The Water Page](http://www.thewaterpage.com/important-water.htm)\)

Using a house plant and a micro:bit we will find a way to detect how dry the soil is and if it's too dry, give our plant some water. We'll test our process, so that we only give the plant as much water as it needs when it's thirsty, just using the water that is necessary for our plant to thrive.

### Things you will need:

* micro:bit with battery pack
* moisture sensor 
* water pump
* a plant to water

### Let's get started
